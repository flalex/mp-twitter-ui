# Project 1 - Twitter UI
Imagine weâ€™re at a hackathon and our goal is to create a simple interface that allows users to submit a Tweet. Your tool must meet the following criteria:
## Requirements:
Only use HTML, vanilla javascript, and CSS (no libraries, frameworks etc)
Include a form with a submit button
Submit an HTTP POST request (you can use a dummy url)
Limit the user input to a maximum of 120 characters (no use of maxLength attribute)
Host the tool on a service of your choice (e.g., Vercel, Render.com, GitHub Pages, etc) so it is publicly accessible.
## Submission Instructions:
Share the source code (e.g., via a GitHub repository).
Provide a public link to the hosted tool.
Note: The interface does not need to connect to Twitter/X. It also does not need to be beautiful - just functional. The primary focus of this project is on building the user interaction.
